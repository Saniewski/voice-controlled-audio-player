## Project Structure
### Audio Player
An audio player web app was built entirely by [Mark Hillard - https://codepen.io/markhillard/pen/jOOKxM](https://codepen.io/markhillard/pen/jOOKxM) and all credits for this part of the project go to him.

The only part that was added by me is `main.py` for locally hosting the web page.

### Voice Controller
This part of the project is responsible for connecting to the audio player using Selenium and providing a way to control the playback. The module listens for messages in the queue and executes the corresponding command when message arrives.

### Command Interpreter
The core module of the project, where the user's voice is recognized, converted to text, and then matched to the list of supported commands. When a match is found, the corresponding command is pushed to the message queue, which then will be retrieved and executed by the `Voice Controller` module.

### Command Recognition Research
This part was used only for exploring the libraries. It is not used in the final project, but files are provided for reference.

### Recordings
Recordings for research were recorded by me in GarageBand and by default are kept in `recordings` folder, with a separate directory for each command. Those files are omitted from the repository.
